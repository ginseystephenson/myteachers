      <h1>About the course</h1>
      <p>Media Writing focuses on the format and style required for writing in the media. This includes writing in AP style format with the inverted pyramid technique. The course focuses on the technical side of writing, being straightforward and relaying the most important information to the public. I have been given the opportunity to meet professionals in my desired field of work and meet new and interesting people due to this course. </p>
      <h2>My Professor</h2>
      <p> My professor for this class is Mr. Dale Jenkins. Mr. Jenkins got his bachelor’s degree at the University of North Carolina–Chapel Hill. An important tibet of information to note is that he hates Duke University with every bone in his body. So if you happen to be a Blue Devils fan and have Mr. Jenkins as your professor, tread carefully. Before becoming a professor at Virginia Tech, he was a successful journalist. In his professional career, has held the positions of: Academic Coordinator Supervisor for Bluefield College, Academic Coordinator for Degree Candidates at Bluefield College, Assembly of Literature and Culture of Appalachia, Mid-Eastern Association of Educational Opportunity Personnel, and served on the Society of Professional Journalists. As a successful and experienced journalist, Mr. Jenkins now dedicates his time to helping his students excel in their desired career paths. </p>
      <h3>My Opinion</h3>
      <p>Freshman year, I had Mr. Jenkins as my Communications Skills professor. Due to my progress in Communication Skills, I thought I had the upper hand going into his Media Writing class. I did not. As the writing format in Media Writing is completely different from how I wrote every single paper last semester, I was less prepared than I originally thought. As I tend to fall on the shy side, I was overwhelmed when Mr. Jenkins told the class we would have to schedule in person interviews for our paper’s this semester. Calling and scheduling an interview with a successful news anchor for my first assignment was daunting to say the least. However, after going through with the interview, I learned more than I thought I would. Since the first assignment, I have grown far more than I expected, personally and academically. My writing has improved immensely within a short period of time, along with my ability to step outside my comfort zone. I have truly enjoyed being in another class with Mr. Jenkins as my professor. He is passionate about his job, and loves working with students. Also, he is easily approachable and readily available to help his students with any issues they may be struggling with. While Media Writing is a rigorous course, it was been worth every bad grade, because Mr. Jenkins has taught me more than I ever could have imagined. </p>
