     <h1>About the course</h1>
      <p>Introduction to Theatre covers a number of different plays that open students up to a new perspective on the art of theatre. The course is designed for students to read the plays assigned, and discuss them in class. The discussion is shaped around the plot of the play, the history of the playwright, and the relevance to today’s society. There are 10 plays this semester: Othello, A Doll’s House, The Glass Menagerie, A Raisin in the Sun, The Foreigner, How I Learned to Drive, Proof, The Laramie Project, August: Osage County, and Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo. Another requirement to the class is attending 2 plays outside class that are put on by the theatre department. The plays this semester were Decision Height and Angels in America. </p>
     <h2>My Professor</h2>
      <p> The professor for this class is Susanna Rinehart. Ms. Rinehart got both her Bachelor’s degree and her Master’s in Fine Arts from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. She received the Advancing Women Award in 2005 and the Virginia Tech Teaching Award. Ms. Rinehart was also earned the Women and Minority Artists and Scholar Lecture Series Grant (2x) and the School of Performing Arts and Cinema Faculty Research Grant. She was appointed to the Academy of Faculty Services at Virginia Tech in 2015 and serves on the Virginia Tech Faculty Senate and University Council. She is passionate about the theatre and loves seeing written plays come to life on stage. Her favorite place on campus is the Squires Studio Theatre because her colleague designed it. Ms. Rinehart’s enthusiasm towards theatre carries throughout her classes as she is doing what she loves.</p>
      <h3> My Opinion </h3>
      <p>Ever since middle school, I have never found reading plays to be my forte. Shakespeare was always difficult to comprehend due to the outdated language and it never seemed to grab my interest. I’m not saying I hate plays, but I would much rather watch or act in one, than just read it. The interesting aspect with Intro to Theatre is that we are able to see the plays come to life. Sometimes Ms. Rinehart will show the play after we’ve read it, making it more enjoyable to me. As a visual learner, I find it easier to see the play unfold before my eyes, rather than in text. I am glad I choose to take the class; however, it does not capture my interest as much as I anticipated. My favorite part would be seeing the plays outside class, because while it is time consuming I think it is cool to see the live production. Professor Rinehart is very passionate about the content she teaches, and I appreciate the work she puts into the course, even though the subject matter is not particularly my favorite. Overall, the class has been a positive experience and I have no regrets choosing to take it. </p>
