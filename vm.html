     <h1>About the course</h1>
      <p>Visual Media is about the visual communication techniques utilized  in today's society. In this course, I have learned how to use Adobe photoshop, InDesign, and Premier. On top of that, I am learning how to build my own website. The purpose of the course is to introduce students to the digital tools used in the field of communications. By having students work with professional programs gives them a broad skill set. Students that have experience with multiple advanced programs have an advantage over other who have only used one. The projects I have completed in this class have given me a collection of skills will further help me excel in my future outside college. </p>
      <h1>My Professor</h1>
      <p> My professor for this class is Dr. Carlos Evia. Dr. Evia attended Texas Tech University, getting his PhD. He currently works in the Communications Department at Virginia Tech as a Professor.</p>
